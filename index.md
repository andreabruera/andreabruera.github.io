## Summary

I am a **final year Ph.D. student in Computer Science** in the [CogSci group](./http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of [Massimo Poesio](./https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=89aa1X0AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao). 

Very broadly, I am interested in what goes on in the brain when we think about things in the world, and the way in which we remember them (good ol' **semantics**). 

I investigate brain - electroencephalography (**EEG**), magnetic resonance imaging (**fMRI**) - and behavioural data using cutting-edge methods from **machine learning**, Artificial Intelligence (**AI**), and in particular Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) - (large) language models, language statistics and distributions, corpora.

My Ph.D. project revolves around the semantics of **individual entities and proper names** (entities referred to by proper names, such as ’Yasujiro Ozu’ or `Cafe Oto'). They are particularly interesting when compared with generic stuff such as trees, windows, birds - think about how easy and embarrassing it is to forget somebody's name! In jargon, their meaning is extremely fine- grained and social in nature. Because of these challenges, I look at how these are **represented in brains and machines**, and I try to bring together both cognitive and computational approaches.

## Bio

During my Ph.D., I have also been a **visiting Ph.D. student** at the [Language, Learning and Reading lab](./https://lrlac.sissa.it) at SISSA in Trieste, and at the [COLT group](./https://www.upf.edu/web/colt) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. 

Also, while on a break from my Ph.D., I worked as a **Junior Research Scientist** at [SAP Security Research](./https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/09/why-are-we-doing-security-research-at-sap/) in Mougins, France, on applying NLP techniques for de-identification and data anonymization. 

I hold a **BA in Philosophy** from the University of Torino and a **M.Sc. in Cognitive Science** from the University of Trento.

On the side, I also co-manage/am part of [SØVN Records](./https://sovnrecords.bandcamp.com), a small DIY label of experimental and avant-garde music - if you feel adventurous, check out [a compilation](./https://sovnrecords.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-queuing-at-the-supermarket)  we recently released!
