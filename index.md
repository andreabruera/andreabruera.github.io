## Summary

The topic of my Ph.D. is the investigation of **how the representations of individual entities - entities referred to by proper names, such as ’Jacinda Ardern’ - are shaped and structured, both in the brain and in artificial intelligence models of language**. In both cases it has been shown that individual entities have peculiar features when compared with generic entities such as trees, windows, birds - mostly because they are extremely fine- grained in meaning and social in nature.

The methodology that I am applying lies therefore at the **intersection of computational linguistics (Natural Language Processing - NLP) and cognitive neuroscience**. The aim is making the most of both approaches, in order to provide relevant evidence for both fields. From a neuroscientific perspective, models of language from computational linguistics, especially when implemented as vectors as in distributional semantics, are of particular interest. They provide a way to isolate very precise phenomena in the brain, by using machine learning to map from the models to the brain, or the other way around. From the point of view of artificial intelligence, brain data allows to directly quantify the cognitive plausibility of each model, by comparing the fit between models and brain data.

As brain data recording technique, I am using mostly **electroencephalography (EEG)**, which captures cognitive brain processing as reflected by electric signals recorded on the scalp, but also **magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)**.

## Bio

I am a **3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science** in the [CogSci group](./http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of [Massimo Poesio](./https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=89aa1X0AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao). My Ph.D. project revolves around the semantics of individual entities and proper names, looking at how these are represented in brains and machines, and trying to bring together both cognitive and computational approaches. 

I was a **visiting Ph.D. student** at the [Language, Learning and Reading lab](./https://lrlac.sissa.it) at SISSA in Trieste, and at the [COLT group](./https://www.upf.edu/web/colt) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. 

Also, while on a break from his Ph.D., I worked as a **Junior Research Scientist** at [SAP Security Research](./https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/09/why-are-we-doing-security-research-at-sap/) in Mougins, France, on applying NLP techniques for de-identification and data anonymization. 

I hold a **BA in Philosophy** from the University of Torino and a **M.Sc. in Cognitive Science** from the University of Trento.

On the side, I also co-manage/am part of [SØVN Records](./https://sovnrecords.bandcamp.com), a small DIY label of experimental and avant-garde music - if you feel adventurous, check out [a compilation we recently released](./https://sovnrecords.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-queuing-at-the-supermarket)!
